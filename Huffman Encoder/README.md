# Huffman-Encoder

This project is a program that compresses and decompresses basic .txt files using Huffman encoding
(assuming only Ascii characters are present in the original file). 

NOTE this project is for my data structures course (CSCI-22) at Harvard Extension, and some starter files
were proviced (please see the "Starter Files" folder for reference).

Please see the PDF for the assignment's instructions.

This is currently a working first version (work in progress).
