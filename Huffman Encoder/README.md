# Huffman-Encoder

This project is a program that compresses and decompresses basic .txt files using Huffman encoding
(assuming only Ascii characters are present in the original file). 

NOTE this project is for my data structures course (CSCI-22) at Harvard Extension, and starter files
were provide mostly to handle some of the file I/O and bitwise operations. Please see the "Starter Files"
folder for reference.

Please see the PDF for the assignment's instructions.

This is currently a working first version. Future releases will include additional exception handling.
